title: 3D Printing nametag - Using Prusa Slicer
---

## How did I do this?
As a mission from a class, I was supposed to make a double color print of our name tags, so I decided to go for a green-on-white look. The process started with me designing the nametag, which I did in Prusa Slicer V2.7.1. Here's a screenshot of the process. You can see that I played with the font and rotations a bit:

The settings I used were 60C bed temp, 215C nozzle temp, using PLA filaments, on a Prusa Mini. This model has built in auto bed-leveling, and is a lot more beginner friendly than the old Ender-3's in the MakerLab last semester.

Being a dual-color print, I was supposed to change the filament when the first bit has done printing. With a click of a button and the filament sensor being there, I simply pulled it out and fed the new filament through the tube, and that was it. After purging the old filaments, the process ended smoothly. Here's the name tag while it's printing:

This is the finished product. The picture quality is not great, but you can still see the texture that gives it the '3D-printed' look.
