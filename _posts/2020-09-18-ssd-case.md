title: Minimalistic SSD Case
---

## What is it?
 This is a simplistic case that can protect your SATA SSD, while having decent performance of heat dissipation. Here's a preview of the result of the project. I only tried it out on a Samsung 860 EVO, but it should work on other models as long as they have the same shape.

## How?
Well, I built the model using Blender, a free 3D modelling and animating software for designers. I used a boolean modifier for the SSD slot, and a mirror modifier to make it symmetrical. I also left a space where an SATA-to-Type-c adapter can be placed, which is shown on the picture below.

Well, that's mostly it.
