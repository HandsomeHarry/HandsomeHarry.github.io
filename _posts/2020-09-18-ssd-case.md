title: Minimalistic SSD Case
---

## What is it?
 This is a simplistic case that can protect your SATA SSD, while having decent performance of heat dissipation. Here's a preview of the result of the project. I only tried it out on a Samsung 860 EVO, but it should work on other models as long as they have the same shape.

## How?
Well, I built the model using Blender, a free 3D modelling and animating software for designers. I used a boolean modifier for the SSD slot, and a mirror modifier to make it symmetrical.

3D-printing machines are not available for everyone, so I recommend using those online 3D-printing service to print, and they'll mail them to you after it's finished. Convenient!

The two crossing strips might seem loose when printed out, but after the SSD is installed, the strips will get tightened, so no worries on that.

 I also left a space where an SATA-to-Type-c adapter can be placed, which is shown on the picture below. Actually I built this case just to make my data more portable at a lower cost.

That's mostly it. Thanks for reading!
