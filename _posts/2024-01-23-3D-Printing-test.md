title: 3D Printing test

## Why did I do this?
Having taken the new ENGR-11 course at my university, I got the mission of making a 3D print and showing it in this writeup. So I started looking for an overhang test, and after a bit of roaming on Thingiverse, I found [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2972495), and here is the final print after 1h02m of printing with PLA on a Prusa Mini, with 60C bed temperature and 215C nozzle temp:

And here's a side view of the print

This is the underside, you can see the drooping gets worse as the angle went up. Gets more obvious at 60 degrees.
