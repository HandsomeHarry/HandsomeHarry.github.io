## Why did I do this?
Having taken the new ENGR-11 course at my school, I got the mission of making a 3D print and showing it in this writeup. So here it is:

[![top-view](/picture/3d-print-1/top-view.jpg)](/picture/3d-print-1/top-view.jpg)

Here's a side view of the print
[![side](/picture/3d-print-1/side.jpg)](/picture/3d-print-1/side.jpg)

Here's the underside, you can see the drooping gets worse as the angle went up. Gets more obvious at around 60 degrees
