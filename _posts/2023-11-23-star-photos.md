## Trip details
Astrophotography is something that requires mental strength, as one may need to stay up until 6am in the middle of nowhere for some good pictures (as I have). I've always dreamed of photographing a lake with stars reflected in it, so after seeing the weather forecast, I went to lake Winnepesaukee right before christmas for some really clear skies. 

## Some Gears I Used
Camera: Canon EOS 6D<br>
Star Tracker: Skywatcher Star Adventurer 2i Pro<br>
Lens: Sigma 24mm f/1.4 Art, Canon 24-70mm f/2.8, Canon 70-300mm f/4-5.6<br>
<br>

>pen1s. Notice the slight reflection of the bright bit in the center, that's caused by the UV filter.

Really wish I had a diffusion filter with me on this trip. However I found many ways which I can improve in on this trip. Looking forward to the next one!
