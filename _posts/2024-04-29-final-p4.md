# Preparing for 
After building the 3D printed hand, me and my teammates thought of the problem that these people are facing. Some people might have a hand unlike the users of the printed hand, but they suffer from limited functionality on their upper limb, which causes them to fail when trying to hold or grip objects. 
<br><br>
The WHO provides a global estimate of 35-40 mm people who require prosthetics. In the United States, about 35000 people have amputations at the hand currently, and 0.009% of births are with an absent hand or fingers. For an estimation with a very large margin, using an estimated 4mm/yr birth rate in the US, a current population of 336 million (U.S. Census Bureau), hand amputation rate of 0.02 per 100000 people (Science Direct), thereâ€™s about 67.2 new cases per year related to trauma plus a congenital absent birth of 360 per year. 
<br><br>
People who suffer with these hand injuries are subjected to needing a caretaker/nurse/guardian to help with these tasks every second of the day, so we decided to make a product that solves the problem, and gives them the freedom that they deserve.
<br><br>
# Inspiration
Here's a link to a product that inspired us: [Fork and Spoon Support](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/product/fork-and-spoon-support/01tJR00000068zYYAQ?t=1710507551533)
After seeing this, we had the idea of making this into an adaptable thing, just like Apple's MagSafe phone connector.

Here's a joint we are thinking of using on our print:

[![joint1](/picture/final1/joint1.jpg)](/picture/final1/joint1.jpg)
It screws in a ball joint, but it limits the diameter of what can be used, and also might not be that good for use of people with upper limb disability.
[![joint2](/picture/final1/joint2.jpg)](/picture/final1/joint2.jpg)
This picture is the clip that goes onto the hand, with two parts on the side that is another joint. This one clicks in place but might not be that strong.
<br><br>
I am designing a joint that utilizes magnets in a 'key' that can be fitted on a table or held in another hand to take out the latch. Here is a diagram of how it works:

[![diagram](/picture/final1/diagram.jpg)](/picture/final1/diagram.jpg)
I am very excited to see this go through, but as the size of the magnets are still not determined, and the 3D model is still at work, I'll be updating it as time goes on.
