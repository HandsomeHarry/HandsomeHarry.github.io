# Defining the problem
After building the 3D printed hand, me and my teammates thought of the problem that these people are facing. Some people might have a hand unlike the users of the printed hand, but they suffer from limited functionality on their upper limb, which causes them to fail when trying to hold or grip objects.
Having taken the new ENGR-11 course at my university, I got the mission of making a 3D print and showing it in this writeup. So I started looking for an overhang test, and after a bit of roaming on Thingiverse, I found [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2972495), and here is the final print after 1h02m of printing with PLA on a Prusa Mini, with 60C bed temperature and 215C nozzle temp:

And here's a side view of the print

This is the underside, you can see the drooping gets worse as the angle went up. Gets more obvious at 60 degrees.
