## How did I start?

I first looked for a desk mount for a specific table thickness on thingiverse, and in finding one, I downloaded it and imported it into TinkerCAD to tweak it. I changed the original holder to a hole, that suited a headphone holder that I already have, and imported it into PrusaSlicer to slice and print it. I didn't have a sketch for this design as the process was very simple, but I do have one for the second one. The final print turned out to have a gap slightly larger than I wanted:

The hole here is for the soft headphone holder thing to plug in

You can see that it did not fit on the table, and after some measurements, I got a better measurement for the table, this time 3mm shorter than the old measurement. This time, I thought that it would be such a tight fit that something like this will never happen again. <br><br>
Although the print failed, I still learned a lot from this print. For example, for a 3D print like this, the direction on which it was printed mattered a lot. In this case, you can see the printed clamp crack after some use because the weight of the headphone is being used on the layer:

So I opened up Fusion360 and started designing my second print.

It was my first time using this software, so I had some questions about how it worked. I finally made my design by creating a block and putting other blocks onto it and subtracting them, which created the hole. I used the Fillet tool to create the curved surfaces which I think made the print a lot prettier, and saved materials compared to the last print.

I also made a hole for the cable to go through, solving another problem that bothered me when wearing headphones. Here are some pictures in the process:

The print failed the first time, it had a big hole in it and I don't know what caused it. However, starting it over solved the problem.

Here's the finished print:

I took out the supports with a fork from the dining hall. When I put it on the desk however, I found it to be a bit narrow this time...

I have ideas to improve it now I have the print finished, many of which popped into my head and quickly faded away. I should start documenting things when I think of them. Here's the new design:
